//  Write a program for arithmetic operations ending with a sentinel value of -1.

//  Start off with relevant libraries and create a terminal statement to prompt user input.

//  #include <iostream>
//  #include <fstream
//  #include <limits>
//  #include <string>
//  using namespace std;

//  Create a cout statement that asks for user input and rejects charactern data.

/*  The file begins at the start of the main function and encompasses all the code used to run the program.
    Use the ofstream function and write data to the file using the name the user gives in a string and + ".txt" at the end.
    Make sure before your program begins you then open the file you named so all information is written to it.
    To account for error in opening the file create an if statement that accounts for issues with the file opening.
*/

//  Make sure you are validating user input for values that are not associated with the problem, or
//  using relevant keywords to match more complicated parameters.

/*  While the user is asked to input data the user will have the option to end the code by entering -1.
    Create a character exclusion statement to validate user input and allow only numbers to be submitted for answers.
*/

/*  Next turn the user input into a variable that can be used within the switch case aspect of your program.
    Now prompt the user to choose an option within the menu you built. 
    Make sure you are building a switch case algorithm that holds the information for each operation and 
    keeps track of each time an arithmetic operation is used by incrementing the variable within the switch case. 
    Lastly within case 4 make sure to add input validation for division by zero and give the user an error for it
    and run the code again.
*/

//  Once the user has inputed a choice prompt the user to either choose to calculate more values, or calculate the arithmetic problem they built.

/*  Contain the code for the switch case and its logical math within a while loop, display the menu options within the
    loop as well. It will also be responsible for continuing the code with a prompt as long as options 1 - 5 are chosen.
    Ensure input validation is added to make sure the user can only input options 1 - 5.
*/

/*  All information that pertains to the solution of the problem should be contained within a file that is named by the user.
    Create a string to accomplish the naming of the file and replace it with the usualy text needed to name the file.
    At the end of the program remember to close the file and end the program with return 0.
*/

 // That concludes the program
