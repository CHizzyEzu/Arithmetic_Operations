// Write a program for arithmetic operations ending with a sentinel value of -1

// Start of with relevant libraries and create a terminal statement to prompt user input

// #include <iostream>
// #include <fstream
// using namespace std;

// Create a cout statement that askks for user input and rejects charactern data

// Make sure you are validating user input for values that are not associated with the problem or
// using relevant keywords to match more complicated parameters

// While the user is asked to input data the user will have the option to end the code by entering -1

// Turn the user input into a variable that can be used within the calculation part of your program

// Now prompt the user to choose an option within a menu you built 

/* Make sure you are building a switch case algorithim that holds the information for each operation
When that happens turn the choice into a variable and use that within the equation aspect of the code */

// Once the user has inputed a choice prompt the user to either choose to calculate more values or calculate the arthemtic problem they built

/* Contain the code for the switch case and its logical math within a while loop, display the menu options within the
    the loop and the loop will keep track of how many times the user inputs data and output solution,
    it will also be responsible for continuing the code with a prompt as long as options 1 - 5 are chosen
    for each iteration of a choice being picked the code will increment its count for each various menu option chosen within 
    each switch case
*/

// All information that pertains to the solution of the problem should be contained within a file that is named by the user

// Create a string to accomplish the naming of the file and replace it with the usualy text needed to name the file

// Your file should finally be inputted into a file of your choice (.txt file recommended) and results should show up in that file
